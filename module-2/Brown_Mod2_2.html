    <h2>Chapter Title: Introduction</h2>

    <!-- Paragraph 1 (intro) -->
    <p class="intro">
      I’m James Brown III, a government contract specialist who’s also studying software development to level up my technical and educational toolkit.
      Fitness keeps me grounded and goal-oriented, which fits well with disciplined study habits.
      <span class="sentence">My mission right now is simple: learn to write clean code, start a independent small business, ship projects and keep expanding my network.</span>
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    <p>
      I grew up learning to balance structure with curiosity—perfect training for both contracts and coding.
      Over time I realized how much I enjoy connecting rules to real-world results, which is probably why government contracts and software development clicked.
      I like pulling apart problems, mapping constraints, and landing solutions that actually work.
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
    <p>
      Outside of work and class, I prioritize health, strength, and consistency.
      I’m also business-minded, so I love reading about product strategy and how teams turn ideas into sustainable value.
      When I’m stuck, a long walk or workout usually knocks something loose.
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I want to fuse my contracting expertise with software to build tools that add value.
      The plan is to keep making small wins, learn from feedback, and iterate fast.
      Each assignment is another brick in the wall I’m building.
